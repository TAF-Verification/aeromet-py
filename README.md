Inspired from python-metar, a library writed in Python language to parse Meteorological Aviation Weather Reports (METAR and SPECI).

This library will parse meteorological information of aeronautical land stations.
Supported report types:
* METAR
* SPECI
* TAF

## Current METAR reports

The current report for a station is available at the URL

```
http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/stations/<station>.TXT
```

where `station` is the ICAO station code of the airport. This is a four-letter code.
For all stations at any cycle (i.e., hour) in the last  hours the reports are available
at the URL

```
http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/cycles/<cycle>Z.TXT
```

where `cycle` is the 2-digit cycle number (`00` to `23`).

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```python
from aeromet_py import Metar

code = 'METAR MROC 071200Z 10018KT 3000 R07/P2000N BR VV003 17/09 A2994 RESHRA NOSIG'
metar = Metar(code)

# Get the type of the report
print(f"{metar.type}")  # Meteorological Aerodrome Report

# Get the wind speed in knots and direction in degrees
print(f"{metar.wind.speed_in_knot} kt")       # 18.0 kt 
print(f"{metar.wind.direction_in_degrees}째")  # 100.0째

# Get the pressure in hecto pascals
print(f"{metar.pressure.in_hPa} hPa")  # 1014.0 hPa

# Get the temperature in Celsius
print(f"{metar.temperatures.temperature_in_celsius}째C")  # 17.0째C
```
